## 📘 Project Synopsis

**Bure-Card** is a health-tech solution focused on **secure patient history storage**, **cross-hospital authentication**, and **data unification** across Ethiopia's healthcare system. It enables patients to use a **QR code-based ID system** for fast and secure identity verification at any participating hospital, ensuring **medical continuity**, **data privacy**, and **national interoperability**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

We are addressing two critical issues in the Ethiopian healthcare system:

1. 🔒 **Patient Data Privacy & Distribution**

   - Patient histories are not securely or consistently stored.
   - There's no standardized way for hospitals to access shared data.

2. 📊 **Lack of Centralized Health Data for Epidemiology**
   - Health data is fragmented across institutions.
   - National-level analysis and forecasting are difficult.

---

## 💡 Planned Solution

We are building a **web and mobile application** that allows:

- QR code-based **patient identification**.
- Secure, centralized **patient data management**.
- A shared platform for **hospital interoperability**.
- A **single, universal app** for patients to manage all their medical needs.

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

- 🏥 Seamless **cross-hospital access** to patient records.
- 📁 Improved **insurance and patient verification** processes.
- 📈 Reliable, centralized **public health data** for policy-making.
- 🤖 Strong data foundation for **future AI models** in healthcare.

## 🧩 Fayda’s Role (Recommended)

**Fayda** is critical to the project’s long-term success. It helps by:

- 📇 Providing a **unique, national identifier** for each patient.
- 🧱 Enabling a **consistent data hierarchy and schema**.
- 📊 Feeding into Ethiopia’s **national statistical system** (births, deaths, diseases, etc.).

Fayda ensures data accuracy and supports future health-tech infrastructure.
